# mulle-env

ðŸŒ³ Virtual environment for Unix

![Last version](https://img.shields.io/github/tag/mulle-sde/mulle-env.svg)

**mulle-env** provides a virtual environment as an interactive bash shell.
Developing inside the virtual environment protects you from the following
common mistakes:

* inadvertant reliance on non-standard tools
* reproducability problems due to personal or non-standard environment variables

With **mulle-env** you can easily manage

* the command line tools available in the virtual environment
* additional environment variables with multiple scopes, like on a per-user or per-host basis.

You can turn any directory into a self contained virtual environment.
`mulle-env init` will create a `.mulle` folder to hold all permanent and
temporary data. Remove that folder and the virtual environment is gone.

```
$ mulle-env init -d foo
Enter the environment:
   mulle-env "foo"
$ tree -a foo
foo
â””â”€â”€ .mulle
    â””â”€â”€ share
        â””â”€â”€ env
            â”œâ”€â”€ environment.sh
            â”œâ”€â”€ include-environment.sh
            â”œâ”€â”€ libexec
            â”‚Â Â  â””â”€â”€ mulle-env-bash-completion.sh
            â”œâ”€â”€ style
            â”œâ”€â”€ tool-plugin
            â””â”€â”€ version
```

Customize your environment content by creating a `.mulle/etc/env` folder and
then store your modifications in it. This allows future versions of `mulle-env`
to upgrade files in `.mulle/share` without losing your edits.

Another benefit of the virtual environment is a per-project command shell
history.


Commands            | Description
--------------------|--------------------------------
`mulle-env`         | Virtual environment sub-shell
`mudo`              | Run a command with the unrestricted PATH/environment
`mulle-env-reload`  | Refresh virtual environment variables


## Install

## Packages

OS      | Command
--------|------------------------------------
macos   | `brew install mulle-kybernetik/software/mulle-env`
debian  | `sudo apt-get -y install mulle-env` (but see below)
ubuntu  | same as debian


Otherwise see [mulle-sde-developer](//github.com/mulle-sde/mulle-sde-developer)
how to install mulle-sde, which will also install **mulle-env**.


#### Debian Mulle kybernetiK repository

For apt installation you need to add the Mulle kybernetiK debian repository
first:

```
wget -O - "https://www.mulle-kybernetik.com/dists/debian-admin-pub.asc" | sudo apt-key add -
echo "deb [arch=all] http://www.mulle-kybernetik.com `lsb_release -c -s` main" | sudo tee "/etc/apt/sources.list.d/mulle-kybernetik.com-main.list" > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
```

## What mulle-env does in a nutshell

mulle-env uses `env` to restrict the environment of the subshell to a minimal
set of values. With `env -i bash -c env` you can see the restricted environment

```
PWD=/home/src/srcS/mulle-env
SHLVL=1
_=/usr/bin/env
```

mulle-env adds a few environment variables back to the environment, like
LOGNAME or SSH_AUTH_SOCK, so that an interactive shell keeps functioning like
one would expect to. You can see the effect for yourself with:

```
mulle-env invoke env  # this does not read a custom environment
```

### Custom environment

When a mulle-env subshell executes, the environment is modified by reading a 
profile file `.mulle/share/env/environment.sh`. This file in turn will read 
other files in `.mulle/share/env` and `.mulle/etc/env`. With these files 
you define new environment variables and aliases. 

Usually you do not manually edit this files, but use mulle-env *commands*
to customize these environment files.

If you want to go manual, it's suggested you use `.mulle/etc/env/environment-global.sh`
as a starting point:

Example:

```
mkdir -p .mulle/etc/env
echo "FOO=xxx" > .mulle/etc/env/environment-global.sh
```


## Prepare a directory to use mulle-env

A directory must be initialized, before you can run the **mulle-env** subshell
it it. Let's try an example with a `project` directory. We want a minimal
portable set of commandline tools, so we specify the 'style' as "minimal/tight".

```
mulle-env init -d project --style minimal/tight
```

And this is what happens:

![dox](dox/mulle-env-overview.png)

Temporary and host-specific data is kept in `var`. User edits in `etc`.
`mulle-env` installs its content in `share` (and write protects it).

```
$ mulle-env project
Enter the environment:
   mulle-env "project"
$ mulle-env "project"
$ ls
$ echo $PATH
/tmp/project/.mulle/var/<hostname>-<username>/env/bin
$ ls -l $PATH
total 0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 nat nat 12 Jan 21 22:28 awk -> /usr/bin/awk
lrwxrwxrwx 1 nat nat 15 Jan 21 22:28 base64 -> /usr/bin/base64
...
...
...
lrwxrwxrwx 1 nat nat 14 Jan 21 22:28 which -> /usr/bin/which
```

And we leave the subshell with

```
$ exit
```

You can also run a command in the environment without an interactive subshell
with the '-c' flag, like you would using bash:


```
$ mulle-env -c 'printf "%s\n" "${PATH}"'
```


## Styles

A style is mix of a tool-style and an env-style of the form
`<tool>/<env>`.

The env-style determines the filtering of the environment variables.

The tool-style determines the content of the PATH variable, in the environment
styles `tight`, `relax`, `inherit`.

> Toolstyles can be augmented with plugins. See `mulle-env toolstyles` for
> what's available.

Tool Style        | Descripton
------------------|--------------------------
`none`            | No default commands available.
`minimal`         | PATH with a minimal `/bin` like set of tools like `ls` or `chmod`
`developer`       | PATH with a a set of common unix tools like `awk` or `man` in addition to `minimal`


Environment Style | Description
------------------|--------------------------
`tight`           | All environment variables must be defined via `mulle-env`
`restrict`        | Inherit some environment environment variables (e.g. SSH_TTY)
`relax`           | Like `restrict` plus all /bin and /usr/bin tools
`inherit`         | The environment is restricted but tool style is ignored and the original PATH is unchanged.
`wild`            | The user environment remains unchanged and the tool style is ignored.


## Enviroment

#### Enter the subshell

```
mulle-env
```


#### Leave the subshell

```
exit
```

#### Run any command (from the outside)

```
mulle-env -c ls
```

#### Run a command inside the virtual environment as if outside

```
mudo -e env
```


## Upgrade an environment

To upgrade an environment to a newer mulle-env release use

```
mulle-env upgrade
```


## Manage tools

Tools are your standard unix tools, executables like `cc`, `ls` or `make`.

List all tools

```
mulle-env tool list
```

Add a tool

```
mulle-env tool add git
```

Remove a tool

```
mulle-env tool remove git
```


## Manage environment variables


There are multiple environment variable scopes, that override each other
in top (weakest) to bottom (strongest) fashion. Non-user values will lose
changes on mulle-env upgrades, so don't write into those scopes.


Scope         | User Value | Description
--------------|------------|----------------------------------
`plugin`      | NO         | Values set by a mulle-env plugin
`global`      | YES        | Global user values
`os-<name>`   | YES        | Operating system specific user values
`host-<name>` | YES        | Host specific user values
`user-<name>` | YES        | User specific user values


List all environment variables

```
mulle-env environment list
```

Set an environment variable

```
mulle-env environment --scope global set FOO "whatever"
```

Get an environment variable

```
mulle-env environment get FOO
```

Remove an environment variable

```
mulle-env environment remove FOO
```
